# GIMP Flatpak

This is the official flatpak repository by the upstream GIMP team.

Though you can report bugs specific to this package here, you should
report non-package specific bugs to our main tracker:
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/

## How to do a flatpak release

A step by step procedure for the package maintainer(s) and contributors
when a new build needs to be released.

* Create a branch off the main branch (`master` for a stable release,
  `beta` for a development release), ideally a few days before the
  expected release date. For instance for a stable release:

```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git checkout -b wip/release/2-10-24
```

* In the manifest `org.gimp.GIMP.json`, update:

  - the "runtime-version" if needed.
  - the version of "org.gimp.GIMP.Manual" extension with the
    `major.minor` version of GIMP.
  - the "version" of "org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin" extension with the following
    scheme: GIMP API (2 or 3) and the Runtime versions (40 for GNOME 40
    runtime for instance). 
  - any dependency module which might be outdated.
  - "babl" and "gegl" module in particular to the last tagged release.

* To check possible updates of some dependency modules use the
  flatpak-external-data-checker tool. Either install it locally, via
  flatpak or via OCI image.

  The OCI image approach is not straightforward at first but is the least
  intrusive if you already have docker or podman installed:
  
```
$ podman run --rm --privileged -v "$(pwd):/run/host:rw" ghcr.io/flathub/flatpak-external-data-checker:latest /run/host/org.gimp.GIMP.json
```

* If the GIMP release has not been tagged yet, set the "gimp" module to
  `HEAD` of the source with the temporary description (replace
  "gimp-2-10" by "master" for a development release):

```
                 {
                     "type": "git",
                     "url": "https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp.git",
                     "branch": "gimp-2-10"
                 }
```

* Push the local release branch to the repo:

```
$ git push -u origin wip/release/2-10-24
```

* Make a pull request of it in: https://github.com/flathub/org.gimp.GIMP/pulls
  
  A build will be automatically triggered and the build bot will notify
  you through comments on the build startup, success or failure.
  The main build interface is: https://flathub.org/builds/

  Note: if any build issue arises which is not because of the manifest
  (temporary build server failure, failed archive download, etc.), you
  can request a new build by adding a command saying only "bot, build"
  in the pull request.

* If you had to update the "version" of "org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin" extension
  (as previously described), also notify if possible maintainers of
  various known plug-ins, i.e. currently only Hubert Figui√®re
  (@hfiguiere), because the plug-ins may have to be rebuilt too. Making
  a comment to the pull request @-naming people's nickname is probably
  enough.

* When the CI build is done, test it (the bot will give you a command
  line to install it). If all works fine, wait for the release day.

* On release day, even if no changes have to be done on the manifest,
  trigger a new build by commenting "bot, build" a few hours before
  source release, because the previous CI build was based on `HEAD` of
  the source from a few days before.
  If any build issue occurs because of a source bug, make sure you fix
  it upstream before actually tagging GIMP main repository.

  Repeat as long as it still doesn't work.

* If all goes fine, wait for GIMP maintainer(s) to tag the main
  repository. When they do, switch the manifest to the new tag and
  corresponding commit, for instance for GIMP 2.10.22, it was:

```
                {
                    "type": "git",
                    "url": "https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp.git",
                    "tag": "GIMP_2_10_22",
                    "commit": "0c8a7891f75a9f41cd36fc0efe2ad506a53d0a15"
                },
```

* Push to the remote and merge. You may want to wait for the CI build,
  but if you did the previous steps fine, this should not be needed
  (there is supposed to be no real source change since your last CI
  build) so you can probably merge directly.

* To be perfectionist, you may want to check https://flathub.org/builds/
  just in case some unexpected error occurs. You can also cancel the
  "Test" CI build (leave only the "Official" build) by logging with your
  Github account on Flathub build page, if you merged before the CI
  build ended.

  Also to speed up the release, you can manually publish the build after
  success, though it is not mandatory (Flathub will automatically
  publish after a few hours).

* Enjoy the rest of the day.
